# 5. EC2

- A **webservice** that provides **resizeable** **compute** capacity.

---

## 5.1 Pricing Models

- **On Demand**: Fixed rate by the hour or by the second.
- **Reserved**: Reserves compute capacity. 1 to 3 year contract, with discount on hourly charge.
- **Spot**: Enables you to pay whatever price you want for instance capacity, if that price is available. It is ideal for when you need the instance between flexible start and end times.
- **Dedicated**: Physical EC2 server dedicated for your use. In some cases, e.g. Oracle where your licenses are bound to a single server, Dedicated might be your only choice.

---

## 5.2 Instance Types

- **F**: Field Programming Gate Array (Real time processing, Financial Analytics)
- **I**: High Speed Storage (NoSQL, Data warehousing)
- **G**: Graphic Intensive (Video Encoding, Application Streaming)
- **H**: High Disk throughput (Map/Reduce based workloads)
- **T**: Low Cost, General Purpose (Web Servers)
- **D**: Dense Storage (File Servers, Data warehousing)
- **R**: Memory Optimized
- **M**: General Purpose (Application servers)
- **C**: Compute Optimized
- **P**: Graphics/General Purpose GPU (e.g Machine Learning, Bitcoin)
- **X**: Memory Optimized (e.g SAP, HANA)

---

## 5.3 Elastic Block Storage

- Virtual Volume on the cloud, attached to an EC2 instance
- EBS Volume **volume sizes and volume types can be changes on the fly**.

### 5.3.1 Volume Types

#### 5.3.1.1 General Purpose SSD (GP2)

- Best Balance between price and performance
- Upto 10,000 IOPS (I/O operations per second)

#### 5.3.1.2 Provisioned IOPS SSD (IO1)

- Designed for intensive I/O operations e.g. databases, NoSQL
- 10000 - 20000 IOPS

#### 5.3.1.3 Throughput Optimized HDD (ST1)

- Low cost HDD designed for frequency accessed, throughput-intensvie workloads

#### 5.3.1.4 Cold HDD (SC1)

- Lowest cost storage for infrequenly accessed workloads

#### 5.3.1.4 Magnetic (Standard)

- **Lowest cost** per gigabyte
- **Bootable**
- **infrequenly accessed** workloads

### 5.3.2 Encryption 

- The root EBS Volume of provided AMIs (Amazon Machine Images) are **not encrypted**. 
- To encrypt them, you can use a **third-party tool**, or you can **create your own Amazon Machine image** where the root volume is encrypted.
- Additional EBS Volumes can be encrypted

### 5.3.3 Regions & Availability Zones

- The EBS Volume is always in the **same availability zone as the EC2 instance**.

**How can you move an EBS Volume from one AZ/region to another?**

1. Create a snapshot of the volume.
2. Copy the snapshot into a different region.

- For the root EBS Volume, ideally you should stop the instance before taking a snapshot but a snapshot can be taken while the instance is running. Stopping the instance before capturing a snapshot ensures that the data is consistent.

**How can you create an EC2 instance with an encrypted EBS root volume?**

1. Create an EC2 instance with an unencrypted EBS Volume. 
2. Stop the instance and take a snapshot of the root EBS Volume.
3. Copy the snapshot and check the encrypted checkbox.
4. Select the encrypted snapshot and click on 'Create Image'.
5. From AMIs, select the encrypted boot drive image. You will now be able to create an EC2 instance with an encrypted boot drive. 

> Exam Tip; Review `Upgrading ESB Volume Types - Lab` before taking the exam.

##Â 5.3.4 RAIDs

- Redundant Array of independant disks
- A number of EBS Volumes are connected together to act as one large Volume.
- These are used when you can't get the desired performance from Amazon's EBS volumes and you'd like to increase disk i/o

- **RAID 0**: Striped: Data is divided evenly between 2 or moredisks. No redundancy. Good Performance. If one disk fails, all data will be lost.

- **RAID 1**: Data in one disk is mirrored to another disk. Mirrored.

- **RAID 5**: Requires 3 or more disks. Data is divided between all disks except one, which stores the parity (a checksum that can be used to restore data in case one of the disk fails). Amazon discourages from creating RAID 5s

- **RAID 10**: Combination of RAID 0 and RAID 1. Data is divided evenly between 2 or more disks and is also mirrored in other disks. Redundancy and performance.

**How do you take a snapshot of a RAID?**

- Snapshots exclude data held in the cache by the application and by the OS. This is acceptable for single volumes but not acceptable with RAIDs. 

- To create an application-consistent snapshot, we need to first stop the application from writing to the disk, flush the cache and then take a snapshot.s

To stop the application from writing to the disk and flush the cache, we can do one of the following:

- Freeze the file system
- Unmount the RAID array
- Shut down the EC 2 instance

---

## 5.4 Termination

- EC2 instance termination protection is turned **off** by default.
- By default, when an EC2 instance is terminated, the root **EBS volume is deleted**.
- Additional volumes added to the instance will not be terminated. This will incur costs.

---

## 5.5 Security Groups

- A Security Group is a **virtual firewall**
- An instance can have **one or more** Security Groups
- A Security Group **blocks all inbound** traffic by default. All **outbound traffic is allowed** by default.
- Changes to security group are **applied instantly** (e.g. let's say an access port is removed from a security group e.g port 80). This makes sense because you want security rules to update immediately.
- Security Groups are **stateful**. This means that as soon as an inbound traffic rule is set, a corresponding outbound security rule is set as well. So if we allow inbound traffic from port 80, we also allow outbound traffic from port 80.
This applies even if we remove the outbound rules from the AWS Console.
- Security Groups **enable you to specify allow rules**. It does not enable you to specify deny rules (for that, you'd use: Network Access Control Lists)

---

## 5.6 AMIs

- Amazon Machine Instances can either be **backed by an EBS volume** or be **by an instance store**.

## 5.6.1 Instances backed by EBS

- For **instances backed by EBS**, the volume is created from an **EBS snapshot**.
- Instances backed by EBS **can be stopped*.
- Data will not be lost in EBS when stopped.

## 5.6.1 Instances backed by EBS

- For **instances backed by instance store**, the store is created from an **template on S3**. 
- Instances backed by instance store **can NOT be stopped**. They can only be terminated.
- Once instance is terminated, **data is lost**.
- Instances backed by instance store **taking longer to provision (i.e. longer to load)**.

---
## 5.7 Load Balancer

- **Virtual machine** that **balances load** between **two or more web servers**.

### 5.7.1 Types

- **Application Load Balancers**: 
- **Network Load Balancers**: 
- **Classic Load Balancers**: 

#### 5.7.1.1 Application Load Balancers

- Sit at the Application layer of OSI model; can make **application specific routing decisions**
- best suited for load balancing of **HTTP and HTTPS traffic**

#### 5.7.1.2 Network Load Balancers

- Sit at the TCP layer of OSI model
- Capable of **handling millions of requests per second**, 
- **low latencies**,
- **extremely high performance**

#### 5.7.1.2 Classic Load Balancers

- Legacy
- Sit at the Application layer of OSI model; but **can NOT make application specific routing decisions**
- You can load balance HTTP/HTTPS loads
- Used for the X-Forwarded-For header

### 5.7.2 Load Balancing Error

**504 Gateway Timeout** 

- Load balancer is running but it is not able to get a response from the EC2 instance.

### 5.7.3 The X-Forwarded-For Header

- When a load balancer balances requests, the EC2 instance views requests coming from the load balancer rather than the user's public IP address.
- The user's public IP address is then passed in the `X-Forwarded-For` header.

## 5.7.4 Health Checks

- A load balancer **conducts health checks** on the servers that it balances. 
- An instance is **InService** if the health check succeeds.
- An instance is **OutOfService** if the health check fails.

## 5.8 CloudWatch

### 5.8.2 Monitoring Types

- **Standard** Monitoring is **every 5 minutes**.
- **Detailed** monitoring is **every minute**.

### 5.8.2 Defult Metrics

The following metrics are available by default on CloudWatch for an instance:

- **_C_ PU** related metrics
- **_D_ isk Usage** (Read/Write Operations)
- **_N_ etwork** related (requests-in, requests-out, packets-in, packets-out)
- **_S_ tatus Checks**: 

### 5.8.3 CloudWatch features

- **Dashboard**: Create dashboard with widgets displaying AWS environment metrics
- **Alarms**: Set alarms when thresholds are hit.
- **Events**: Responds to state changes in AWS resources (e.g. terminated, stopped), triggers a lambda function
- **Logs**: Aggregate and Store logs. An EC2 instance needs to be created

> CLOUD WATCH IS NOT THE SAME AS CLOUDTRAIL. CLOUD WATCH IS FOR RESOURCE MONITORING. CLOUD TRAIL IS FOR AUDITING ACTIVITY ON AWS.

### 5.9 AWS CLI Commands

**Confiuring Access Key ID, Secrey Access Key**

```
aws configure
```

Credentials will be stored in plain text in `~/.aws/credentials`.

**List S3 buckets**

```
aws s3 ls
```

**List all ec2 instances**

```
aws ec2 describe-instances
```

**Terminate EC2 instance**

```
aws ec2 terminate-instances --instance-ids <InstanceId>
```

**Recursively copy files from s3 to an ec2 instance**

```
aws s3 cp --recursive s3://<bucket-name> ~/ --region=<instance-region>
```

----

## 5.10 Securing AWS CLI 

- The AWS cli stores credentials in `~/.aws/credentials`. This is risky because if the instance becomes compromised, credentials might be used for nefarious purposes.
- It is therefore recommended to use IAM roles instead. 

- Instance is assigned a role e.g. **S3FullAccess**
- AWS-CLI running on that instance can not access S3 without requiring credentials to be set.

---

## 5.11 Bootstrap Script

- A script is set when creating an ec2-instance.
- The commands will run when the instance is launched.
- Commands will be run at root level (`sudo` is not required)

```
#!/bin/bash
yum update -y
yum install httpd -y
service httpd start
chkconfig httpd on
cd /var/www/html
aws s3 cp s3://elasticbeanstalk-us-west-2-838107339577/index.html /var/www/html
```

---

## 5.12 !! Instance metadata

- Instance metadata can be obtained by sshing into the instance and then running the command `curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/` .
- This command will list the meta-data that is available e.g. `public-ipv4`.
- To store this data to a file, we could run the following command:

```
curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/public-ipv4 > ~/public-ipv4.text
```
- The boostrap bash script that was set up when creating the instance is accessible via `http://169.254.169.254/latest/user-data/`.

---

## 5.13 Elastic Placement Groups

There are two types of Placement Groups

- **Clustered Placement Groups**: When a group EC2 instances are grouped inside the same availability zone to reduce latency and increase throughput. e.g. Cassandra Clusters, Big Data

- **Spread Placement Group**: When a group EC2 instances are placed on distinct underlying hardware. Ensures that instances are across multiple devices in multiple availability zones. Redundancy

- Only certain kinds of instances can be launched in a placement group e.g. `Compute Oprimized`, `Memory Optimized`, `Storage Optimized` or `GPU`

- Placement Groups must have a unique name per AWS account (**not** universally unique)

- EC2 instances inside a placement group should be homogenous (same size, same type)

- An existing EC2 instance can not be added to a placement group. 

----

## 5.14 EFS (Elastic File Systems)

- File storage service for EC2 instances
- Storage capacity is elastic; it grows and shrinks as files are added or deleted
- Uses NFS protocol
-

**Questions**

1. An on-demand EC-2 instance is charged by what unit?
2.
