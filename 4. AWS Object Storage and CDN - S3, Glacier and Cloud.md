# 4. AWS Object Storage and CDN - S3, Glacier and CloudFront

## 4.1 - S3

### 4.1.1 Basics

- Object based storage (upload files only. Can't upload Operating systems or Databases)
- File size: 0 - 5 TB
- Unlimited Storage but paid
- Files are stored in buckets (a bucket is a folder that has a unique namespace)
- S3 is a universal namespace: all names must be universally unique
- [!] URL Structure of an S3 bucket is as follows

`https://s3-[region-name].amazonaws.com/[bucketname]`

- When a file is uploaded successfully, a HTTP 200 response is returned.

### 4.1.2 Data Consistency Model

- **Read after Write consistency for PUTS of new objects**

This means that once the file has successfully been written to the S3 bucket, a user will be able to **immediately** read that file (immediate consistencty)

- **Eventual Consistency for overwrite PUTS and DELETES (can take some time to propogate)**

This means that if an existing file is updated or deleted, it may take some time for the changes to propogate across availability zones. In otherwords, rereading the file immediately after making changes may show the old version or the up-to-date version.

### 4.1.3 Key-Value Storage

- Object based
- Object consits of:
- **Key**: the name of the file
- **Value**: A bag of bytes
- **Version ID**: Version of the file
- **Metadata**: data about the file
- **Subresources** e.g. Access Control Lists (list of users, groups roles that can access the file)

### 4.1.4 Storage Classes

**S3 Standard**

- **99.99% availability**: Files will always be available to access
- **99.99% durability**: Files are guaranteed to not be lost.
- Stored redundantly on multiple devices in multiple availability zones.
- Designed to sustain loss of 2 availability zones

**S3 - IA (Infrequenct Access)**

- files that are accessed less frequently, but need rapid access
- Cheaper than S3 standard.
- Retrieval fee per GB retrieved.

**S3 One Zone - IA**

- Same as S3-IA, however file is stored in only one availability zone, instead of two
- hence cheaper than S3-IA.
- used for storing data whose loss can be tolerated.

**Glacier**

- Files that aren't access frequently at all (i.e. archived) and do not require rapid access.
- Expedited: Retrieval will take a few minutes 
- Standard: Retrieval takes 3 - 5 hours
- Bulk: Retrieval takes 5 - 12 hour

### 4.1.5 Charges

Charged for:

- Storage (per GB stored)
- Requests (Requests per minute)
- Storage Managemnent Pricing (charged for tags and metadata attached to the Object)
- Data Transfer Pricing (When transferring data from one region to another: Cross-Region Replication)
- S3 Transfer Acceleration (users can upload file to Cloudfront and the file will be transferred to S3 from the edge location rather than directly from the user's network. This accelerates the rate of transfer of the file.)

> **Exam Tip**: Read S3 FAQ before the exam as it is a prominently featured topic.

### 4.1.6 Access Control

- Buckets are private and all objects stored inside them are private.
- If an object is public, but then it is updated, the object's access will be reset to private.
- Access to an object is controlled by Bucket Policies and by ACL (Access Control Lists)

### 4.1.7 Encryption

1. Client Side Encryption
2. Server Side Encryption

- Encrypted with Amazon S3 managed keys
- Encrypted with KMS keys
- Encrypted with customer provided keys

### 4.1.8 Versioning

- Stores all version of the document (including all writes and even when an object is deleted)
- Once versioning is enabled, it can only suspended. It can not be disabled.
- MFA rules can be applied to deleting an object in a bucket.

### 4.1.9 Cross-Region Replication

- Cross-region replication is the copying of objects from one bucket in one region to a bucket in another region
- Source and destination buckets must have versioning enabled.
- Once Cross-Region Replication is configured, files are not replicated automatically. Updates to the files will be replicated.
- Delete markers are not replicated.
- Deleting a version of an object is not replicated.

### 4.1.10 Lifecycle Management

- Automtically transitions objects (and their versioned) to tiered storage e.g. Transition object to S3 - IA after 30 days and transition object to Glacier 30 days it was transitioned to s3-ia.
- Lifecycle management can be applied to both object and its versions.
- Allows you permanently delete files if not access.
- Useful to cut down on costs storing files that are not used accesed very often.
