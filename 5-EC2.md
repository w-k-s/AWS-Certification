# 5. EC2

- A **webservice** that provides **resizeable** **compute** capacity.

---

## 5.1 Pricing Models

- **On Demand**: Fixed rate by the hour or by the second.
- **Reserved**: Reserves compute capacity. 1 to 3 year contract, with discount on hourly charge.
- **Spot**: Enables you to pay whatever price you want for instance capacity, if that price is available. It is ideal for when you need the instance between flexible start and end times.
- **Dedicated**: Physical EC2 server dedicated for your use. In some cases, e.g. Oracle where your licenses are bound to a single server, Dedicated might be your only choice.

## 5.2 Instance Types

- **F**: Field Programming Gate Array (Real time processing, Financial Analytics)
- **I**: High Speed Storage (NoSQL, Data warehousing)
- **G**: Graphic Intensive (Video Encoding, Application Streaming)
- **H**: High Disk throughput (Map/Reduce based workloads)
- **T**: Low Cost, General Purpose (Web Servers)
- **D**: Dense Storage (File Servers, Data warehousing)
- **R**: Memory Optimized
- **M**: General Purpose (Application servers)
- **C**: Compute Optimized
- **P**: Graphics/General Purpose GPU (e.g Machine Learning, Bitcoin)
- **X**: Memory Optimized (e.g SAP, HANA)

## 5.3 Elastic Block Storage

- Virtual Volume on the cloud, attached to an EC2 instance
- EBS Volume **volume sizes and volume types can be changes on the fly**.

### 5.3.1 Volume Types

#### 5.3.1.1 General Purpose SSD (GP2)

- Best Balance between price and performance
- Upto 10,000 IOPS (I/O operations per second)

#### 5.3.1.2 Provisioned IOPS SSD (IO1)

- Designed for intensive I/O operations e.g. databases, NoSQL
- 10000 - 20000 IOPS

#### 5.3.1.3 Throughput Optimized HDD (ST1)

- Low cost HDD designed for frequency accessed, throughput-intensvie workloads

#### 5.3.1.4 Cold HDD (SC1)

- Lowest cost storage for infrequenly accessed workloads

#### 5.3.1.4 Magnetic (Standard)

- **Lowest cost** per gigabyte
- **Bootable**
- **infrequenly accessed** workloads

### 5.3.2 Encryption 

- The root EBS Volume of provided AMIs (Amazon Machine Images) are **not encrypted**. 
- To encrypt them, you can use a **third-party tool**, or you can **create your own Amazon Machine image** where the root volume is encrypted.
- Additional EBS Volumes can be encrypted

### 5.3.3 Regions & Availability Zones

- The EBS Volume is always in the **same availability zone as the EC2 instance**.

**How can you move an EBS Volume from one AZ/region to another?**

1. Create a snapshot of the volume.
2. Copy the snapshot into a different region.

- For the root EBS Volume, ideally you should stop the instance before taking a snapshot but a snapshot can be taken while the instance is running. Stopping the instance before capturing a snapshot ensures that the data is consistent.

**How can you create an EC2 instance with an encrypted EBS root volume?**

1. Create an EC2 instance with an unencrypted EBS Volume. 
2. Stop the instance and take a snapshot of the root EBS Volume.
3. Copy the snapshot and check the encrypted checkbox.
4. Select the encrypted snapshot and click on 'Create Image'.
5. From AMIs, select the encrypted boot drive image. You will now be able to create an EC2 instance with an encrypted boot drive. 

> Exam Tip; Review `Upgrading ESB Volume Types - Lab` before taking the exam.

##Â 5.3.4 RAIDs

- Redundant Array of independant disks
- A number of EBS Volumes are connected together to act as one large Volume.
- These are used when you can't get the desired performance from Amazon's EBS volumes and you'd like to increase disk i/o

- **RAID 0**: Striped: Data is divided evenly between 2 or moredisks. No redundancy. Good Performance. If one disk fails, all data will be lost.

- **RAID 1**: Data in one disk is mirrored to another disk. Mirrored.

- **RAID 5**: Requires 3 or more disks. Data is divided between all disks except one, which stores the parity (a checksum that can be used to restore data in case one of the disk fails). Amazon discourages from creating RAID 5s

- **RAID 10**: Combination of RAID 0 and RAID 1. Data is divided evenly between 2 or more disks and is also mirrored in other disks. Redundancy and performance.

**How do you take a snapshot of a RAID?**

- Snapshots exclude data held in the cache by the application and by the OS. This is acceptable for single volumes but not acceptable with RAIDs. 

- To create an application-consistent snapshot, we need to first stop the application from writing to the disk, flush the cache and then take a snapshot.s

To stop the application from writing to the disk and flush the cache, we can do one of the following:

- Freeze the file system
- Unmount the RAID array
- Shut down the EC 2 instance

---

## 5.4 Termination

- EC2 instance termination protection is turned **off** by default.
- By default, when an EC2 instance is terminated, the root **EBS volume is deleted**.
- Additional volumes added to the instance will not be terminated. This will incur costs.

---

## 5.5 Security Groups

- A Security Group is a **virtual firewall**
- An instance can have **one or more** Security Groups
- A Security Group **blocks all inbound** traffic by default. All **outbound traffic is allowed** by default.
- Changes to security group are **applied instantly** (e.g. let's say an access port is removed from a security group e.g port 80). This makes sense because you want security rules to update immediately.
- Security Groups are **stateful**. This means that as soon as an inbound traffic rule is set, a corresponding outbound security rule is set as well. So if we allow inbound traffic from port 80, we also allow outbound traffic from port 80.
This applies even if we remove the outbound rules from the AWS Console.
- Security Groups **enable you to specify allow rules**. It does not enable you to specify deny rules (for that, you'd use: Network Access Control Lists)
