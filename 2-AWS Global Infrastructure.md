# AWS Global Infrastructure: 

- **Region** is a Geographical Area. Each region consist of 2 or more Availability Zones.

- **Availability Zone** is one or more discrete data centers, each with redundant power, networking and connectivity, housed in seperate facilities. i.e. If there is an issue at one data center in an availability zone, it won't affect the other. 

- **Edge Locations** are Endpoints for AWS that are typically used for caching. They are used by Cloudfront (Amazon's CDN).
